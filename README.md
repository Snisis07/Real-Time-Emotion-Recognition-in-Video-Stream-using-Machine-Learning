# Real-Time-Emotion-Recognition-in-Video-Stream-using-Machine-Learning
This project aims to develop a deep learning model capable of recognizing emotions in real-time video streams. By leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), the system will analyse facial expressions and body language to detect emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and surprise. The model will be trained on a diverse dataset of labelled video clips and optimized for performance on live video feeds, making it suitable for applications in security, customer service, education & healthcare.
